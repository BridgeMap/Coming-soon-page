    <p class="article-text">
      At 18 years old, I found myself at a crossroad that changed the route of my
      life exponentially. While the overwhelming advice when you finish school is
      to further your education with a university degree, that wasn’t an option
      for me, and like so many other young people, I was at a loss for what I was
      supposed to be doing.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      If you are certain with what you want to do then there is a natural, and
      arguably obvious, progression. But when you are unsure and don’t know what’s
      out there, the route can feel hugely daunting. With my closest peers at
      university, I felt I was floundering and falling behind, and as a
      consequence my mental health suffered. I know I’m not the only one who has
      been in this position.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      After months and months of searching online I found some work experience
      with Futureversity, a charity offering support and summer activities for
      young people. It was here I discovered how many organisations are out there
      that offer support and guidance to young people facing difficulty in their
      life, whether it be their personal or financial situation, physical or
      mental wellbeing, or in their working life. I was exposed to professional
      advice and opportunities that made the crossroads I had felt stuck at in my
      own life, suddenly much clearer.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      Often when we are unsure of something, we Google it. But it is hard to know
      what to search for when you don’t really know what you’re looking for.
      Sometimes when you’re a young person, you can recognise you need help, but
      what sort of help you need is harder to define. Futureversity gave me access
      to the information and guidance I needed, without having to search it out.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      Crucially, I learnt that there are an extraordinary amount of organisations
      out there who work solely with young people to improve their lives and give
      them opportunities that often feel unobtainable. But, like I said, how do we
      know they’re out there, if we don’t know what to look for?
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">Cue, <b>BridgeMap.</b></p>
    <p class="article-text">
      The transition from childhood to adulthood should be easier, and I wish
      there had been a clear platform out there to guide my transition; something
      my younger sisters could use if they are ever struggling or in need of help.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      There are thousands of organisations in the UK offering a variety of
      services free of charge to young people. However, an overwhelming number of
      young people remain unaware of the opportunities available to them, leaving
      them feeling neglected and many of these services underutilised.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      BridgeMap is a free platform designed to change this. It is an online
      directory that young people (10-25) can use to find organisations that can
      support and advise them for free on any number of different challenges they
      may be facing. From career advice to homelessness support, BridgeMap links
      these organisations into one central platform for young people to easily
      navigate. It will explain what each organisation does, the benefits on offer
      and how they can be contacted. Think of it as a GoCompare website, but for
      life guidance support services rather than insurance.
    </p>
    <h5 class="article-subheading">How can you help?</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
      The more organisations that BridgeMap connects with, the more effective the
      platform. If you are an organisation or know of a good organisation, and you
      or they provide a service for young people, please do let us know.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      BridgeMap is volunteer-run, so if you’re a professional with expert advice
      you feel could help, whether it be mentoring and encouraging young people,
      facilitating workshops or providing other charitable services, please get in
      touch! Alternatively if you have a skill you think the BridgeMap could
      benefit from, also get in touch with us.
    </p>
    <h5 class="article-subheading">What else are we offering?</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
      Through building BridgeMap site, we will be giving aspiring developers an
      opportunity to work on it. This will give them an insight into what a
      typical development process is like hence prepare them for their first job.
      They will also be provided with mentoring and guidance to help them secure
      their first job.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      Additionally, our team is available to run practical and hands-on technical
      workshops for young people. We are open to do this for companies and
      organisations who list-no-decorationfocus on improving young people’s lives.
